How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, Express, MongoDB 
So the main points with this app is that I use a post and put method combined with click functions to allow the user to post thier favorite song and a comment to the page. Then when the anyone presses either the thumb up or thumb down button a click function runs it increases or decreases the amount of likes for each comment.Fianlly if you would like to delete your comment then you can press the trash can icon that activates a click event that deletes the comment from the database.

Optimizations
(optional)
If I had time to come back to this I would want for to allow users to be able to edit thier comments after they post them instead of deleting and starting over.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to manipulate the database after using myown server and how to refresh the page using nodemon to allow me to do update the project without killing the server.
